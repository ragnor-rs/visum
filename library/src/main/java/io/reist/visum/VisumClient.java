/**
 * Visum framework addresses these tasks:
 * - providing inversion of control
 * - construction of MVP architecture
 *
 * To achieve that, Visum provides two interfaces:
 * - {@link VisumClient} - implement to take advantage of dependency injection
 * - {@link io.reist.visum.view.VisumView} - an extension to VisumClient which represents MVP views
 *
 * Visum recommends the following structure of application:
 * Views ({@link android.app.Activity}, {@link android.app.Fragment} or {@link android.view.View})
 * have Presenters injected into them.
 *
 * A configuration change view causes view a loss of data which hasn't been explicitly saved.
 * But the attached {@link io.reist.visum.presenter.VisumPresenter} survives configuration change
 * thus pertaining all the data stored inside of it.
 *
 * The presenter re-attachment is carried out by the {@link ComponentCache}
 * (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/ragnor-rs/mvp-sandbox/blob/develop/app/src/main/java/io/reist/sandbox/app/SandboxComponentCache.java">SandboxComponentCache</a>)
 * provided by local {@link android.app.Application} class. The client code also must provide Visum
 * with a singleton component and a singleton presenter (e.g, with means of Dagger framework).
 *
 * Injection is handled automatically via reflection during {@link VisumClientHelper#onCreate}.
 * A corresponding component must be public and declare a public 'inject' method which accepts this
 * client as a parameter.
 *
 * @see VisumClientHelper#INJECT_METHOD_NAME
